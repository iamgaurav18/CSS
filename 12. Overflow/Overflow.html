        <br>    
        visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
        <br>
        hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible            scroll - The 
        <br>
        overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
        <br>
        auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Overflow">
        <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>
        <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>
        <p class="visible">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</p>
        
        <h2 id="hidden">Overflow: hidden</h2>
        <p>With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden</p>

        <h2>Overflow-x and Overflow-y</h2>

        overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
        <br>
        overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.</p>
        <p class="overflow-xy">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</p>
