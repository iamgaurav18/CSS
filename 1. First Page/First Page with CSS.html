    <h1>First HTML page with External CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental component of web development. It provides the means to control the visual presentation and layout of web pages. CSS enables designers and developers to define how HTML elements should appear on the screen, from fonts and colors to spacing and positioning. It plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing and responsive websites, allowing for consistency and flexibility in design across different devices and screen sizes. CSS empowers web professionals to transform plain HTML documents into engaging and user-friendly web experiences, making it an essential tool in modern web development.</p>
