    <h1>Float and Clear</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Float</h3>
        <p>
            The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.
            <br>
            The float property can have one of the following values:
            <br>
            left - The element floats to the left of its container <br>
            right - The element floats to the right of its container <br>
            none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default <br>
            inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
        </p>
        <div class="colors">
            <p id="red">Red</p>
            <p id="yellow">Yellow</p>
            <p id="blue">Blue</p>
            <p id="green">Green</p>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Clear and ClearFix</h3>
        <p>
            The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
            <br>
            The clear property can have one of the following values:
            <br>
            none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default <br>
            left - The element is pushed below left floated elements<br>
            right - The element is pushed below right floated elements<br>
            both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements<br>
            inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent<br><br>
            When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. <br> Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.
