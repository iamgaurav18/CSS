        <p>The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
        With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).</p>

            Padding can be defined as the gap between the container and its content. Examplae here the padding will be the space between the text and the paragraph container.
            <br><br>
            Padding can be written in same way as border. <br> 
            ex: padding: top right bottom left
            <br><br>
            Box-sizing:-borderbox
            <br><br>
            thiss will keep the width of the container same even if the padding is changed.
