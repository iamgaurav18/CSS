    <h1>Display Property in CSS</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
            <br>
            Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
        </p>
        <h3>Display None</h3>
        <p>
            display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.

            The &lt;script&gt; element uses display: none; as default. 
        </p>
        <h3>Visibility Hidden</h3>
        <p class="hidden">visibility hidden also hides an element.

            However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout</p>
